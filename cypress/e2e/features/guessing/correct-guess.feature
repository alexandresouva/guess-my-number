Feature: Player makes a correct guess
  As a player, I want to receive clear feedback when I guess correctly, so that I know Iâ€™ve won and can see my score.

  # Tip: The focus of BDD is to describe "what" and not "how" things work.
  Scenario: Player guesses the correct number
    Given I am on the game page for guessing
      And I have at least 1 attempt remaining
    When I guess the correct number
    Then the message "ðŸŽ‰ Correct number!" is displayed
      And the timer stops immediately
      And the interface updates to show the correct number
      And the secret number is revealed
      And the final score is calculated and displayed
      And the high score is updated if necessary
