Feature: Player makes an incorrect guess
  As a player, I want feedback when my guess is incorrect, so that I can adjust my next attempt accordingly.

  Scenario: Player makes a guess that is too high
    Given the player has X attempts remaining (where X > 0)
    And the timer is running
    When the player inputs a guess higher than the secret number
    Then the system shows the message "Too high!"
    And the remaining attempts decrease by 1
    And the timer keeps running

  Scenario: Player makes a guess that is too low
    Given the player has X attempts remaining (where X > 0)
    And the timer is running
    When the player inputs a guess lower than the secret number
    Then the system shows the message "Too low!"
    And the remaining attempts decrease by 1
    And the timer keeps running

Feature: Player makes a correct guess
  As a player, I want to receive clear feedback when I guess correctly, so that I know Iâ€™ve won and can see my score.

  Scenario: Player guesses the correct number
    Given the player has made a correct guess
    And the timer stops immediately
    Then the message "ðŸŽ‰ Correct number!" is displayed
    And the secret number is revealed
    And the screen background color changes to green
    And the final score is calculated using the formula:
      remaining_attempts Ã— 15 - elapsed_time_in_seconds
    And if the calculated score is less than 10, then the final score is 10
    And the final score is displayed to the player

Feature: Player loses after using all attempts
  As a player, I want to be informed when I lose after all my attempts, so that I can understand the outcome and the correct number.

  Scenario: Game over after exhausting all attempts without a correct guess
    Given the player has used all 5 attempts without guessing correctly
    Then the message "ðŸ«¤ Game over..." is displayed
    And the timer stops immediately
    And the final score is zero
    And the secret number is revealed
